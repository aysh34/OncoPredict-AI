This project, named **OncoPredict AI**, leverages machine learning to build a robust and accurate system for early breast cancer detection. Utilizing the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, we develop a predictive pipeline that classifies breast masses as either benign or malignant based on digitized image features of cell nuclei.

The core methodology involves comprehensive data preprocessing, in-depth exploratory data analysis to understand feature distributions and correlations, and meticulous feature engineering. Critical steps include proper data splitting into training and testing sets, followed by robust feature scaling to ensure unbiased model training.

Two powerful classification algorithms, Logistic Regression and Random Forest, are implemented and rigorously optimized using hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation. The models are evaluated on a suite of metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrices, and ROC curves with AUC scores, prioritizing the minimization of false negatives crucial in medical diagnostics.

OncoPredict AI aims to provide a highly reliable and interpretable tool that can significantly aid in the early and accurate diagnosis of breast cancer, contributing to improved patient outcomes and enhanced healthcare decision-making.
